# masterthesis
An overview repository for my thesis code

The title was "Classical simulation of a free induction decay in \ce{CaF2} and extension to hybrid quantum approaches"

Here, a raw, unpolished view into my thesis is provided. The code is probably not executable because some dependencies are missing, such as HDF5 files provided by other people.
